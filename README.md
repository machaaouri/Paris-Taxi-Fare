## Running the project
1) clone repo
2) npm install
3) `npm run dev`, and the server will start on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000).

4) `npm test` to run tests

Webpack will watch the files. Once you save a file, you can refresh your browser to ensure you got the updated client files. If you only change server files, you *shouldn't* need to refresh.
